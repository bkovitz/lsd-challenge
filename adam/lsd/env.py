    A class that represents an environment in which variables are bound to values.

    This class is a specialized dictionary where:
    - The keys are variable names (strings).
    - The values are tuples, even if they represent a single value.
    - An empty tuple is used to represent "None", indicating that no value is bound to the variable.

    Attributes:
        data (dict): A dictionary that holds variable bindings.

        Initializes an `Env` object with a set of variable bindings.

            bindings (dict, optional): A dictionary of initial variable bindings. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to add to the environment.
