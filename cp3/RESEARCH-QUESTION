RESEARCH QUESTION

Can we make a term-rewriting system (TRS) that, in response to a letterstring
analogy problem, rigs up custom reduction rules that represent the analogy
and, when run on the New World, create the correct rhs?

   Representing the analogy: Making reduction rules that convert the Old World
   lhs to its rhs *and* can run in the New World.

   The analogy-making process must be biased in a human-like way to make
   reduction rules that are as general as possible. For example, a very poor
   solution to:

         abc -> abd
         ijk -> ?

   would be "'abc' maps to 'abd'". That couldn't even run in the New World
   because it doesn't make the lhs there. Almost as poor would be "lhs maps
   to 'abd'", which would lead to filling in the New World rhs with 'abd'.

   The search bias should determine (a) the sequence in which possible
   analogy-elements are explored and (b) which of two or more possibilities
   is deemed superior.

Maybe: Can we come up with a mathematical proposition that says under what
conditions analogies can be constructed in this way, and prove it as a
theorem?
