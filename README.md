# LSD Challenge
Like the ARC Challenge but for the letter-string domain used by Copycat and Metacat

## Current Plan

* Section 8.2
    1. Chunk[abc]
    2. Chunk[abd]
    3. Delta
    4. Chunk[ijk]
    5. Delta creates chunk for "blank"
    6. Run ^ chunk and it fails
    7. Rerun delta to create new chunk
    8. Run new chunk to fill blank

* Section 8.3...8.7

* See how many we can do from appendix
