# Mob Programming

## Theory
- *For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else's hands.* (Strong-style pairing)
- *Disagree and commit* Commit to implementing the team's idea and making it work as well as you can, even if you disagree with it.
- Contribute *the right thing at the right time, and in the right way*
  - Hold off on contributing an idea until you judge that the time is right.
  - Don't interrupt some flow that's going right now.
  - Let an idea run to completion rather than interrupt it midway to start a whole different approach.
- Use common-sense and self-discipline.

## Roles
The roles alternate at a regular interval, such as seven minutes.

### Driver
- Controls keyboard.

### Navigator
- Thinks of ideas.
- Tells driver what to do next:
  - at highest level of abstraction that works
  - move to the next lower level of abstraction if abstraction is unclear.
  
### Mobber
(Everyone else)
- Check code for errors
- Search stuff on Internet
- Jot down notes
- Record people's ideas on the whiteboard
- Whatever you think helps the team at the moment

## Original notes

From Ben:

1. The "driver" is at the keyboard. One other person is the "navigator". (Both other people can play this role at the same time, once we're good at this.) The navigator tells the driver what to do next, at the highest level of abstraction that works. If the driver doesn't know some details about how to implement something, then go to a lower level of abstraction for a bit. If you're the navigator and aren't sure what to do next, ask for discussion.

2. We rotate roles every 7 minutes (or whatever duration we set). Once you're done as the driver, you move to the navigator role. With some practice, we should be able to rotate the next driver into the driver's seat in a few seconds.

3. "For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else's hands." (This is known as strong-style pairing.) The driver should strive to be an intelligent input device. Ask questions for clarification while you're the driver; hold off on putting in your own ideas until you become the navigator.

4. We'll try to make most decisions by consensus, but occasionally there will be disagreements. When the time required to try two ideas is short, we'll try them both, one after the other, rather than argue. Sometimes, though, we will need to make a group decision that not everyone agrees with. At these times, the principle to follow is "Disagree and commit"---that is, commit to implementing the team's idea and making it work as well as you can, even if you disagree with it.

5. When you're neither driver nor navigator, you're a "mobber". Then you play any other sort of role: check code for errors, search for stuff on the Internet, jot down notes, record people's ideas on the whiteboardâ€”whatever you think helps the team at that moment.

6. Seek to contribute "the right thing at the right time, and in the right way". Exactly what that is is a matter of judgement, but it implies that sometimes you hold off on contributing an idea until you judge that the time is right. You might want to jot an idea down to suggest later, so you don't interrupt some flow that's going right now. It's usually best to let an idea run to completion rather than interrupt it midway to start a whole different approach.

7. The ideal physical set-up has everyone in the same room, with everyone facing the driver's screen on a big monitor. But the set-up doesn't need to be ideal.

8. Mob programming requires discipline, but common sense should prevail.
